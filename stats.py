"""
Statisticians would like to have a set of functions to compute the median and mode of a list of numbers. 
The median is the number that would appear at the midpoint of a list if it were sorted. 
The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Define these functions in a module named stats.py. 
Also include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. 
Each function expects a list of numbers as an argument and returns a single number.
